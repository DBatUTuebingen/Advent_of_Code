-- Plan:
-- - store monkeys in a table, one row per monkey (here: N = 8 rows)
-- - CTE working table columns: turn | monkey | items | ...,
--   cardinality of WT in each iteration is N
-- - increment column turn (see below), monkey turn % N is active
--   (later, can use column turn to identify round ≡ turn / N)
-- - in each iteration:
--   - in a subquery of q⭯, identify active monkey
--   - perform computation for that monkey,
--     subquery yields pair: monkey-thrown-to | thrown-item
--   - top-level query left-joined to subquery
--     (subquery may be empty if items list of active monkey is empty)
--   - in top-level query of q⭯, iterate over all monkeys m:
--     - turn:  if (m is active monkey and item list empty) or monkey-thrown-to is NULL,
--              increment turn, otherwise unchanged
--     - items: if m is active monkey, remove first item in items list
--              if m is monkey-thrown-to, add thrown-item to back of items list
--              otherwise, items unchanged
--     - all other columns unchanged
