APL code that inspired this solution:

--                                       follow   dx,dy
--                                    ┌───────────┐┌─┐
-- follows ← {p ← 0 0 ⋄ (⊂0 0),{p+←(××(1⍨<⌈/⍤|))⍵-p ⋄ p}¨⍵}
-- argument of follows is sequence of positions for the head H

1. compute absolute positions of H (SUM SCAN over moves), starting from (0,0)
2. start with current T position (tx,ty) = (0,0)
3. iterate over positions (hx,hy) in H:
   -- compute difference (dx,dy) between (hx,hy) and (tx,ty)
   -- new current position of T (tx,ty) = (tx,ty) + follow(dx,dy)
